# ConversationAlign

## Overview
An R package for analyzing semantic and affective alignment between speakers in natural language transcripts. One of the primary applications of this package will be analyzing attributes of intergenerational communication.

## Installation
Install the development version of ConversationAlign from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by typing the following in your console or script (make sure you have devtools installed):

``` {r, eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Reilly-ConceptsCognitionLab/ConversationAlign")
```

## Prep your language transcripts
Move your Otter.ai text files or CSV files into a folder.  The default folder name is 'my_transcripts'. If you want to specify your own folder name in the root directory that's fine too. You will call that path as an argument to the first function called read_dyads()

## Read your transcripts into R
### read_dyads()
This will read all your files and concatenate them into a single dataframe, appending document IDs
```{r, eval=F}
myrawtranscripts <- read_dyads()
myrawtranscripts <- read_dyads(/my_customfolder)  #if specifying a custom folder path
```

## Clean your transcripts
This step uses regular expressions to clean and format your data, eliminating stopwords, changing the case to lower, omitting whitespaces and non-alphabetic characters, etc.
```{r, eval=F}
#takes object from the read_dyads step
mycleantranscripts <- clean_dyads(myrawtranscripts)
```
